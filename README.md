    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Profile isort",
            "type": "process",
            "command": "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}/Programs/Python/Python311/Scripts/py-spy.exe", // correct path for your system
            "args": [
                // py-spy arguments
                "record",
                "--output", "${workspaceFolder}/profile.json",
                "--format", "speedscope",
                // profiled app arguments (isort)
                "--",
                "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/Scripts/python.exe", // venv for profiled app (setup needed)
                "${workspaceFolder}/isort",
                "--diff",
                "--check",
                "--verbose",
                "C:/Projects/django/django", // running isort on django repo to collect profile samples
